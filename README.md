# Agri-Field Monitor using ML Interfacing with IoT

## Overview  
**Agri-Field Monitor using ML** is an IoT-integrated machine learning-based system for real-time insect and pest detection in agricultural fields. Utilizing an **ESP32-CAM** module and **TensorFlow**, this system identifies insects, animals, and objects, helping farmers analyze their impact on crops and take preventive measures.  

## Features  
- Real-time object detection using **YOLOv3**.  
- Integration with **ESP32-CAM** for image capture and processing.  
- Uses **OpenCV** and **cvlib** for image processing.  
- Provides insights into seasonal insects (harmful/beneficial).  
- Can be extended to other domains like **traffic monitoring and surveillance**.  

## Hardware Requirements  
- **ESP32-CAM Module**  
- **FTDI Module**  
- Power Supply & Connectors  

## Software Requirements  
- **Arduino IDE** (for ESP32-CAM programming)  
- **Python** (for object detection processing)  
- **TensorFlow, OpenCV, cvlib**  

## Future Scopes  
- Can be extended to other domains like **traffic monitoring and surveillance**.
